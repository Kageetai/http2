note:
    big sites often end up with a lot of different JS files
    therefore after developing these are often merged together into one single big file with different front-end tools
    minification tries to shrink these big files by removing redundant data
    again browser cache needs to be rebuild when changing these
    also complicates the build process and is inconvenient during development
