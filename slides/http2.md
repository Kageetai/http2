### HTTP2 <!-- .element: class="section-title" -->

- Internet Engineering Force (IETF)
- http2 draft-00 made from SPDY/3 draft
- specification finalized in February 2015
- big browsers only implement HTTP2 for TLS (https)
- [implementations widely available (even servers)](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations) growing quite fast, considered how young it is

note:
    developed within the Internet Engineering Force (IETF)  
    SPDY showed that it could perform and adaption was available  
    http2 draft-00 made from SPDY/3 draft  
    specification finalized in February 2015  
    all requirements for SPDY are implemented in HTTP2  
    only requirement for HTTPS was dropped  
    but all big browsers decided to only implement HTTP2 for TLS (https)  
    URL schemes cannot be changed and old clients and server will be around for a while so down-compatibility is a must
